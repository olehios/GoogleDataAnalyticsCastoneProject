# Project title: Building Machine Learning Model for solving employee retention problem.
# Project Overview: In this project, I used Python for model building and data analysis. I tested and trained different models to analyze a dataset and generate business insights for my stakeholders. In particular, I evaluated a logistic regression model and the following machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, XGBoost. I also updated my stakeholders through an executive summary where I presented my findings and came up with some possible solutions and propositions regardng the problem.
